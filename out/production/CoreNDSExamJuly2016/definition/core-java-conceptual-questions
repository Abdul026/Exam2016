 Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?

You call the constructor by using the keyword new , followed by the name of the class, followed by any necessary parameters.

Ans:JAR stands for Java Archive. It is a compressed file, which means that it is a file that has been reduced in size.
 This is often done to speed up distribution over the Internet and to save storage space. BitZipper can open and create JAR files.


What is compile time and run time?
Ans: The source code must be compiled into machine code in order to become and executable program. This compilation process is referred to as compile time.
A compiled program can be opened and run by a user. When an application is running, it is called runtime.

What is heap?
Ans: The JVM has a heap that is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays are allocated.
It is created at the JVM start-up. The heap size may be configured with the following VM options: -Xmx<size> - to set the maximum Java heap size.




How java manage it's memory?

Ans: Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected.
During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.



What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

Ans: StringBuffer and StringBuilder have the same methods with one difference and that's of synchronization.
StringBuffer is synchronized( which means it is thread safe and hence you can use it when you implement threads for your methods)
 whereas StringBuilder is not synchronized( which implies it isn't thread safe).
